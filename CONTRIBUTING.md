# Contributing

To contribute, please fork the repository and develop in a branch. Proposed changes should be "squash merged" into the master branch of your fork and the PR should be from `<your_fork>/master` to this
repository's master branch.

# Code Formatting

I do not use the standard `scalafmt` code style because it is unreadable. You can submit a PR with any code formatting you desire but please note that it will be reformatted before it is merged.

The formatter used on this project is packaged in [this Intellij IDEA configuration](https://github.com/reynoldsm88/ide-formatters/blob/master/intellij/intellij-settings-09-2021.zip).
